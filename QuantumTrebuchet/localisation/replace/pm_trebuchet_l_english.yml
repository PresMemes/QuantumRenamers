 tutorial.2126.desc:0 "The §SQuantum Trebuchet§! launches ships and fleets across vast, interstellar distances. This technology greatly improves our ability to react to emerging situations within our empire, and in nearby regions of space.\n\nUse of the Quantum Trebuchet carries some risk, as our fleets may arrive in systems other than their intended target. We can mitigate these risks - and improve matters like throughput and maximum range - by upgrading the Quantum Trebuchet to higher tiers."
